# v2pn
v2pn, a very simple but usable Android vpn app based on https://github.com/v2fly/v2ray-core and https://github.com/xjasonlyu/tun2socks

installation:

1. use gomobile to generate .aar from https://github.com/garymaxallen/v2ray
2. put .aar in app/libs folder
3. gradlew.bat assembleDebug/installDebug

I'm an android amateur/rookie, only care about usability.

So this app is very simple, only for personal use.

It doesn't have fancy settings UI.

Change settings in https://github.com/garymaxallen/v2ray/blob/master/main/confloader/external/external.go
